# Pixel Profile Website 🎨

A visually appealing personal profile website with a pixel art aesthetic. This project aims to provide a unique and engaging way to showcase an individual's skills, projects, and contact information. It leverages HTML, CSS (including Tailwind CSS), and potentially JavaScript to create an interactive and memorable user experience. The core purpose is to present information in a retro, pixelated style, reminiscent of classic video games.

🚀 **Key Features:**

*   **Pixel Art Aesthetic:** Employs custom CSS classes and styling to achieve a distinctive pixelated look and feel throughout the website.
*   **Responsive Design:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS utility classes to ensure the website is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
*   **Sectioned Layout:** Organizes content into logical sections (Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Contact) for easy navigation and readability.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Includes buttons and links for navigation and calls to action, enhancing user engagement.
*   **Smooth Scrolling:** Implements smooth scrolling behavior for a seamless user experience when navigating between sections.
*   **Self-Contained Structure:** Designed to be largely self-contained, minimizing external dependencies and simplifying deployment.
